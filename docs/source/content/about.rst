About oneDSolver
================

oneDSolver is a c++ code that solves for blood pressure and flow in deformable 1D hemodynamic networks. 

It is the result of contributions from various members of the Taylor's lab at Stanford. 
Some of the main contributors are I. Vignon-Clementel, N. Wilson, J. Wan, B. Steele, G.R.Feijoo, S.A.Spicer, S.Strohband,T.J.R. Hughes and C.Taylor.

The one-dimensional equations for the flow of a Newtonian, incompressible fluid in a deforming, elastic domain consist of the continuity equation, a single axial momentum balance equation, a constitutive equation, and suitable initial and boundary conditions. The governing equations are derived in a general form by Hughes [91] and Hughes and Lubliner [1]
